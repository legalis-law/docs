## Overview

Checklists are Clerra's primary workflow management tool. They replace the deprecated case timelines system and provide flexible, customizable task management for all cases and matters.

<Note>
  **Case timelines have been deprecated.** All case tracking and workflow management now uses checklists for better flexibility and control.

## Checklist Items

### Creating Checklist Items

Each checklist can have multiple items with detailed properties:

**Required Fields:**
- **Task Name**: Clear description of what needs to be done
- **Status**: Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked

**Optional Fields:**
- **Assignee**: Team member responsible for the task
- **Due Date**: Deadline for completion
- **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
- **Dependencies**: Tasks that must be completed first
- **Description**: Additional details or instructions
- **Attachments**: Related documents or resources

### Task Hierarchy

Organize complex workflows with hierarchical tasks:

```text
Phase 1: Discovery
  ├── Initial Disclosures
  │   ├── Prepare initial disclosure statement
  │   ├── Gather supporting documents
  │   └── Review and file with court
  ├── Interrogatories
  │   ├── Draft interrogatories
  │   ├── Review with case manager
  │   ├── Serve on opposing party
  │   └── Track responses
  └── Document Requests
      ├── Identify needed documents
      ├── Draft request for production
      └── Follow up on production
```

<Tip>
  Use sub-tasks (hierarchical organization) for complex items that have multiple steps.
</Tip>

## Task Status Types

    Task has not been begun, awaiting assignment or prerequisites
  </Card>
  <Card title="In Progress" icon="spinner">
    Work is actively being performed on this task
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completed" icon="circle-check">
    Task is finished and verified
  </Card>
  <Card title="Blocked" icon="circle-exclamation">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Task Dependencies

Link tasks that must be completed in a specific order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Task">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Prerequisite">

  <Step title="Save">
    Dependent task is blocked until prerequisite is completed
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**

## Priority Levels

Set priority to help team members focus:

- **High Priority** 🔴: Urgent tasks, critical deadlines, court dates

## Progress Tracking

### Completion Percentage

Checklists automatically calculate completion:

Completion % = (Completed Items / Total Items) × 100
```

**Visual Progress:**

- Color-coded:
  - Red (0-30%): Just started
  - Yellow (31-70%): Making progress

### Progress Reports

Generate progress reports:
- Checklist completion status
- Time to complete items
- Team member performance
- Bottleneck identification
