## Overview

Clerra provides comprehensive workflow management for cases and matters, using **checklists** as the primary workflow tool. Case timelines have been deprecated in favor of the more flexible checklist system.

<Note>
  **Important**: Case timelines are deprecated. All case tracking and workflow management now uses **checklists**.
</Note>

## Workflow Management with Checklists

Checklists are the primary tool for managing case workflows. See the [Checklists](/cases/checklists) guide for detailed information.

**Key Workflow Features:**
- **Phased Checklists**: Organize work into phases (Discovery, Pleadings, Trial, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Link tasks that must be completed in sequence
- **Assignments**: Delegate checklist items to specific team members
- **Due Dates**: Set deadlines with automated reminders
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators show completion percentage

## Case Assignment & Team Management

### Case Manager (Originating Attorney)

The case manager has special responsibilities:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Primary Responsibilities" icon="user-tie">
    - Overall case strategy and direction
    - Client communication and relationship management
    - Budget and billing setup (has setup_case_billing permission)
    - Team assignment and workload distribution
    - Final review and approval of deliverables
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Special Permissions" icon="key">
    - Setup case billing and rates
    - Approve time entries and expenses
    - Close or archive the case
    - Assign/remove team members
    - Access all case documents and communications
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Assigning Team Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Case Details">
    Navigate to the case you want to update
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Team Section">
    Click on the **Team** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Team Members">
    - Click **Add Team Member**
    - Select user(s) from your workspace
    - Assign their role on the case (Attorney, Paralegal, etc.)
    - Set their billing rate (if different from default)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Assignments">
    Team members receive notification and gain access to the case
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Team members are automatically drawn from the case's assigned department. Cross-department assignments can be made when needed.
</Tip>

## Department-Based Workflow

Cases are automatically associated with departments:

**How It Works:**
1. User logs in → automatically logged into their assigned department
2. Creates case → case automatically associated with user's department
3. Team members from same department can view/access the case
4. Cross-department sharing available when needed

<Info>
  Department assignment happens automatically at the backend. Users don't manually select departments when creating cases.
</Info>

## Document Workflow

Documents in cases follow their own workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload">
    Documents uploaded to case vault
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review">
    Team members review and comment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approval">
    Key documents require approval from case manager
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finalization">
    Approved documents marked as final version
  </Step>

  <Step title="Archive">
    Completed documents moved to archive folder
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Billing Workflow Integration

Case workflow integrates with billing:

**Time Tracking:**
- Time entries created as work progresses
- Attached to specific case and matter
- Tagged with department automatically
- Reviewed by case manager

**Invoice Generation:**
- Case manager generates invoices from approved time entries
- Invoices sent for approval workflow
- Approved invoices sent to clients
- Payment tracking integrated with case status

<Warning>
  Only the case manager (originating attorney) can setup case billing. Other users must have explicit super-admin permissions to manage billing.
</Warning>

## Approval Workflows

Cases may require approvals at various stages:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Document Approval" icon="file-check">
    Key documents reviewed and approved before filing or sending
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time Entry Approval" icon="clock-check">
    Billable time reviewed before invoicing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Invoice Approval" icon="receipt">
    Invoices approved before sending to clients
  </Card>
  <Card title="Settlement Approval" icon="handshake">
    Settlement terms reviewed by senior attorneys
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Approval Process:**
1. Item submitted for approval
2. Designated approver receives notification
3. Approver reviews and either approves or rejects
4. If rejected, item returns to submitter with feedback
5. If approved, workflow continues to next stage

## Case Handoff & Transfer

## Automation & Playbooks

Automate repetitive workflows with playbooks:

**Common Automated Workflows:**

- Discovery phase initiation (generate document requests, set deadlines)
- Trial preparation (create trial binder structure, assign tasks)
- Case closure (finalize billing, archive documents, send closure notice)

<Tip>
  See the [Playbooks](/playbooks/overview) section for detailed information on creating and using workflow automation.
</Tip>

## Workflow Monitoring

Track workflow progress across your workspace:

**Available Views:**
- **My Cases**: Cases where you're assigned
- **Department Cases**: All cases in your department
- **Overdue Items**: Tasks and deadlines that are past due
