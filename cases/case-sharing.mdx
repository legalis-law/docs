## Overview

Share cases and matters across departments, with specific team members, or with external clients to enable collaboration while maintaining security and access control.

<Info>
  By default, cases are visible only to members of the department they're assigned to. Sharing allows controlled access beyond department boundaries.

**To Remove Access:**
1. Click on team member

## Sharing Best Practices

<Check>
  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the access level needed
</Check>

<Check>
  **Regular Audits**: Review case access quarterly
</Check>

<Check>
  **Document Sharing Reasons**: Add notes explaining why cross-department access was granted
</Check>

<Check>
  **Remove When Complete**: Remove access when collaboration is finished
</Check>

<Check>
  **Use Groups for Common Patterns**: If same team always collaborates, consider department restructuring
</Check>

<Check>
  **Client Access Carefully**: Only share appropriate documents with clients
</Check>

## Notification Settings

Control notifications for shared cases:

**Default Behavior:**
- Team members notified when added to case
- Updates trigger notifications based on user preferences
- Clients receive notifications for major updates only

**Customize Notifications:**
1. Go to case settings
2. Configure notification rules
3. Set who gets notified for what events
4. Save preferences

## Security & Compliance

### Data Access Logging

All case access is logged:
- Who accessed the case
- When they accessed it
- What they viewed or changed
- Access level at time of access

<Info>
  Audit logs are retained for compliance and available to Super-Admins and case managers.
</Info>

### Revoking Access

Immediately revoke access when needed:

**Emergency Revocation:**
1. Navigate to case
2. Go to Team settings
3. Click **Remove** next to user
4. Access terminates immediately

**Scenarios Requiring Revocation:**
- User leaves firm
- Conflict of interest identified
- Project role changes
- Security concern

## Cross-Workspace Sharing

<Warning>
  **Not Supported**: Cases cannot be shared across different workspaces. Each workspace maintains complete data isolation for security and compliance.
</Warning>

**Alternatives:**
- Export case summary as PDF
- Share specific documents via secure link
- Create duplicate case in other workspace (if appropriate)
- Use third-party collaboration tools for specific documents

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="User can't see shared case">
    - Verify sharing settings are saved
    - Check user's department and role permissions
    - Ensure user has accepted case invitation
    - Confirm no conflicting restrictions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Client portal not working">
    - Verify client has accepted invitation
    - Check spam folder for portal invite email
    - Ensure portal access is enabled for the case
    - Confirm client user account is active
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot share with specific department">
    - Verify you have permission to share cases
    - Check if target department exists
    - Ensure no workspace restrictions prevent sharing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shared user has wrong permissions">
    - Review their access level in case team settings
    - Check their workspace role permissions
    - Verify department-level access rules
    - Update access level if needed
