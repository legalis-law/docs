## Conflict Checking

Automated conflict detection:

### How Conflict Checking Works

1. **Data Collection**
   - Client name and aliases
   - Opposing parties
   - Related companies
   - Previous counsel

2. **Database Search**
   - Search existing clients
   - Search active cases
   - Search archived matters
   - Search excluded parties list

3. **Matching Algorithm**
   - Exact name matches
   - Fuzzy matching for similar names
   - Company affiliation matching
   - Related party detection

4. **Results Review**
   - Potential conflicts highlighted
   - Relationship mapping shown
   - Manual review required for final decision

<Warning>
  Automated conflict checking is a tool, not a replacement for attorney judgment. Always manually review potential conflicts before accepting representation.
</Warning>
