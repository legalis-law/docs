## User Status Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Active" icon="circle-check">
    User has accepted invitation and has active access to the workspace
  </Card>
  <Card title="Invited" icon="envelope">
    Invitation sent but not yet accepted by the user
  </Card>

    User access suspended but data preserved
  </Card>
  <Card title="Removed" icon="trash">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Role Assignment During Invitation

When inviting users, you assign them one of the following roles:

### Workspace Roles
- **Super-Admin**: Full workspace control
- **Attorney**: Legal professional with case management
- **Paralegal**: Legal support staff
- **Member**: Basic team member
- **Client**: External client (read-only)
- **Custom Roles**: Any custom roles you've created

<Tip>
  See the [Roles & Permissions](/users/roles-and-permissions) guide for detailed information about each role's capabilities.
</Tip>

## Department Assignment

<Warning>
  **Department assignment is required** when inviting users. Users cannot be invited without being assigned to a department.
</Warning>

### Why Departments Matter

- **Automatic Access Control**: Users are automatically logged into their department
- **Data Isolation**: Users see cases and data relevant to their department
- **Workload Organization**: Organize teams by practice area, office location, or function

### How to Assign Departments

During the invitation process:
1. Select the appropriate department from the dropdown
2. If the department doesn't exist yet, create it first in Settings
3. Assign the user as a regular member or department head

<Info>
  Learn more about creating and managing departments in the [Departments](/users/departments) guide.

2. Select the user
3. Click **Remove from Workspace**
4. Confirm the action
