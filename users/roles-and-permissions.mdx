## Overview

Clerra uses a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions. The system distinguishes between **workspace-level roles** (for law firm users) and **system-level roles** (for platform administration).

<Note>
  **Admin** role is reserved for oversight/platform administrators. Law firms use **Super-Admin** for workspace management.
</Note>

## Workspace-Level Roles

These roles are available for law firm users within their workspace.

### Super-Admin

**Full workspace control and management**

Super-Admins have nearly all permissions within the workspace. They can manage users, cases, documents, settings, and integrations.
