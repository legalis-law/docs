## Overview

Departments help you organize your Clerra workspace by practice areas, teams, office locations, or any other grouping that makes sense for your firm. Every user must be assigned to a department.

<Info>
  **Key Feature**: Users are automatically logged into their assigned department, and department assignment happens at the backend. Cases and matters are automatically associated with the user's department.
</Info>
