## Approval Process

Time entries and invoices require approval before billing.

## Workflow

1. **Time Entry Submitted**: Attorney logs time
2. **Manager Review**: Case manager reviews entries
3. **Approve/Reject**: Manager approves or requests changes
4. **Invoice Generation**: Approved entries → invoice
5. **Invoice Approval**: Final review before sending
6. **Send to Client**: Approved invoice sent

<Tip>
  Set up approval workflows per case or department.
